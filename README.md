# Common setup for js/ts projects

> The project is setup mainly for a react but can easily be modified for another framework.

`eglavin/rcs` lays out the main setup necessary to get a javascript or typescript project of the ground. Its true that every person has a different opinion on the "best" setup so here's my entry into that ring.

The main tools I always try to use with every project are `eslint`, `prettier` and `typescript` which all work well within the [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) editor.

## Node Installation

Most javascript/typescript projects need the [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) runtime to be installed. The following tool `nvm` lets you install which ever version a project requires using nvm from the command line.

```
nix
https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm

windows

```
